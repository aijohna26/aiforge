I'm a vibe coder >> and I'm a senior iOS engineer >> and today we're going headto head to see who can build a better iOS app directly from our phone. We are both going to try to build an app like Headspace which does over $300 million per year in revenue. And we're both going to be using an app that lets us use cloud code directly from our phone to build a mobile app. You see, Vashall has 10 years of experience coding mobile apps. and I'm just a vibe coder who's never actually written a line of code. But here's the thing, the fastest way for both of us to build a mobile app and get it on the Apple App Store is to use AI to generate everything. The code, the assets like the images, sound effects, voices, music, haptics, and more. With AI, the playing field is leveled. I can generate what took Vashall years to master. And in the comments, you get to decide whose app is better. and we're going to give $50 of credits to the Vibe Code app to 25 different people who vote in the comments below. We're here. We're in the Vibe Studio. Let's dive into the competition. >> Here we go. >> All right, Vishall. First of all, happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. >> We were going to wear costumes. We literally tried to Door Dash Halloween costumes here to wear them in this video, but unfortunately they were out of costumes at the store. You tried, right? >> Yeah, they were uh the order got cancelled actually. the the costumes weren't there and the substitutions weren't there. >> Yeah. So, I was going to be a banana and you were going to be like Scooby-Doo or something. >> Yeah. I mean, you were going to be a nano banana. >> I was going to be nano banana. I was going to put the Google logo on a banana costume and be nano banana. So, in celebration of that, >> that Okay, so the rules today, we both get nothing but our phones. We have our phones here and we are going to both have 1 hour to build an app after the first prompt. So, we get to hang out. We get to relax. As soon as we enter our first prompt, I'm going to start this timer right here. And once this hits one hour, all hands off your phone. And so, obviously, this is we're going to be using the Vibe Code app. And obviously, the Vibe Code app allows us to use Cloud Code on our phone and you can ceue up prompts. So, this is fun. In the Vashall Vashall and I's last video, he had three prompts queued up at the buzzer. So, you're allowed to do that, but whatever app you end up with, that's your final app. >> That's all you get. >> Yeah. So, it's like you get the shot up right before the buzzer. You can get as many shots as you want, but that's it. And so, we're going to be vibe coding from our phone with the brand new and improved Vibe Code app. Let's go ahead and we're both going to hit new project here. I'm curious what direction you're going to go. Um, but maybe you don't want me to know the direction you're going. >> H, you'll you'll find out anyways, but I got some, you know, tricks up my sleeve here. >> Please make a one-page app. We're just going to start off with a very bare bones. This app is going to be just like Headspace. And I just want you to make the very first the page you enter at the beginning of the app. And also, I want you to make a very blank onboarding experience that has like three pages in the onboarding. So, I want to be taken to the onboarding immediately, but I want there to be a skip onboarding option. And then I want to be entered into a blank page that is called Vibespace. So, it's going to be Headspace, but the app is going to be called Vibespace. Search the internet to learn a little bit about Headspace's homepage. All right. So, I have my first prompt and obviously I'm using my voice and Vishall's typing it out. Talk us through yours a little bit. >> Yeah. So, I'm just trying to hear to set up like a nice skeleton. So, I'm giving it the vibe that I want. Mental health, meditation, calmness, tracking. I also named mine already. >> What is it? >> It's going to be called void. >> M >> because >> so good. >> You want your, you know, head to be clear of any thoughts. Your head should be void. >> I like it. >> Yeah. So, I'm telling it to >> present. You want to be in the moment. Clear all the clutter. >> Moment is a great name. I'm sticking right now to having it first just create a onepage onboarding that just asks you for your name. Then a comm welcome page. I'm going to actually tell it with a nice animation. And then you're in the dashboard where there are two tabs. One with moods, the other with vibes. Moods are going to be, you know, depending on how you're feeling, there will be a different mood that will give you like a soundtrack or something to help calm you down or maybe like ask you some questions. And then vibes being like, you know, kind of just play it, close your eyes, and that's the meditation aspect of it. >> I like it. >> Yeah. >> Very solid skeleton, I would say. >> Yeah. Going to start there. >> Obviously, this uses Cloud Code out of the box. >> Yeah. >> And uh I'm just going to choose Cloud Code. Uh Cloud Sonnet 4.5. >> Sonnet 4.5. >> I mean, you got to start with Sonnet 4.5. I mean, come on. You ready? >> Yes. >> All right, ladies and gentlemen, the rules are we get one hour after we enter our first prompt. So, three, two, one, ship it. Start the timer. One really cool thing about Vibe Code is the new pinch to build. And so, here we can see our apps are being created on the right. You can see um Claude Code going to work. But if you press that little uh down arrow, you can get rid of it. You can enter this view. I guess you could call this like pinch view. What do you What view do you call this? >> I call this edit mode. >> Mhm. I call this chat view over here and then >> play mode. >> Play mode. >> Yeah. And so to go from testing your app and obviously right now it's building. You clearly have the new version. What the heck? Um >> unfair cheating. I like it. You know what? I don't need any advantages. So uh anyway, yeah, we have all of this to work with. And while it's loading, I'm going to actually begin designing my app here because we can generate assets. >> Exactly. So that that's one of the special things with this new experience is that while your app is being built, you can actually generate images, audios, you can queue up different prompts with different API integrations. There's a lot of things that you can do in this kind of idle time while cloud code is building. >> Yeah. And while you're explaining that, I'm just cooking. 3D render icon cute. >> Do you usually do icon or character? >> I usually do icon. >> Icon. >> Everything without a background in my opinion is fire. 3D. And so as you can see here, we're just generating assets. I think for a meditation app, I think the design of the meditation app is critical. Yes, in my opinion, just because, you know, that's what's going to attract people. It's like, how does it feel to use? Are they relaxed when they use it? You can't just have features, you know, you need it. It needs to feel good. And that's the essence of vibe coding. Honestly, >> I'm I'm actually going to hold off on creating more than just my base kind of mascot because I'm going to approach this with a different kind of approach of vibe coding. I like it. So, I'll wait for this to finish. You can see the tasks are almost done. Um, it created some state management for onboarding, some codebase structure, onboarding screen, welcome screen, mood screen, placeholder, vibe screen, bottom tab, and navigation. Now, it's updated all the relevant kind of files and we can see exactly, you know, mood screen, vibe screen. Pretty cool. Okay, nice. We should be able to check it out as it's done. It looks like mine is building. I don't know what. >> So, mine is downloading and I think we're ready. It's called void. Journey to inner peace begins here. Just enter visual. Click continue. Oh, wow. And we're in. >> Ooh. Moods and vibes. >> Okay. So, um I am actually So, this is my onboarding it created by default. When I double tap vibes, like the title of the app, I want it to take me back to the onboarding. Also, I'm about to give you assets that I want you to use in the onboarding flow. And I want you to make them like hover in a way that would look pleasing in a meditation app. And make these assets big, only one asset per page. And then I want you to change the copy to be very friendly and uh center it around meditation. Okay. Since you're done with that, I'm going to use this kind of trick that a lot of people who work on AI agents kind of know, which is a lot of times it is better to have the agent come up with a a plan or a spec before you just go in. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk in this prompt and I'm going to have the agent come up with all the different moods I want to support and the different characters and the vibes that I want. >> That's a really good idea. Wow. >> And the the ace up my sleeve here is I'm going to tell it to store this in a file in the app so that it can reference this. >> No, it can reference this later. >> Wow, that's a really good idea. >> Yeah. So >> it's like kind of like the cursor plan or cursor rules file. >> Exactly. Sometimes it's helpful to have like a kind of lightweight plan and just have it there so I can tell it in the future, hey remember the plan, dummy. The first thing that I want to start with is the moods. I want to have around four to six different moods which represent different kind of states that you are not at mental peace. I want each mood to then link to a different page. On that page, there should be a series of questions asking and prompting the user about their mood. The user should not be responding with free form text input as a default. They should pick from different options that relevant that uh represent different reactions to said question. And each mood should have around three to seven questions. And then at the end of it, there should be a long text explaining some advice or what the user could do to feel better for their different mood based on the answers. For this, obviously, we're going to be using one of the AI APIs to analyze the answers that the user gives. So, for now, focus on the questions and the different select options and what the different moods are. Also note that each of the moods will have a different character associated with it. Kind of like the popular Disney movie Inside Out. Please help come up with a plan for this and I want you to store this in a file in the codebase so just that we can reference it later. Also let me know what the character themes are so I can generate the icons and give them to you to use in the app. Go. Okay. So while he was working on that, which sounds like a great prompt, that was very detailed. What I'm doing is I'm generating. So by the way, in the Vibe Code app, you can generate sound effects, music, and voice. So I just generated this song. Fish, what do you think about this song? Wow. So that's going to play during onboarding. >> Three out of 10. Oh, I hate that. I'm sorry. That just isn't good. No, all of these sound like error Mac OS sounds. >> They sound like an error. >> Even that little bit. >> All right, we're going to test it. I can always change this later. I just like to like get it set up. Um, this is the sound effect to play when I press the button in the onboarding to advance to the next page. mental healthation app that is called Void. I love it. So, he's generating a song right now and in the prompt he said a song for an app called Void. I'm very curious to see. I've never tried that. I always try to describe it literally, but like Yeah, we almost need an agent to to kind of handle that. >> Yeah, >> like smart sounds. Whether it's images or audio, you can add them to your prompt and then you tell Cloud Code what you want to do with them. Drift into the void. >> I like it. >> What? It can do this. >> Oh man. >> Oh man. Ready? Ready to concede? Embrace the gentle void. >> This is the best song I've ever heard in my life. >> Oh my god. >> Okay, so he just generated this Beethoven [ __ ] that that's insane. So show So like all you have to do with all of your assets, whether they're images, right, you can select them and then add them to the prompt. And notice here that you can actually click on them directly and it will show you those assets and I believe if it's a song what dude stop cooking. >> So you can see this and you can also rename them. So if you click details here you can actually rename this. So I can like call this guy like I don't know voidy. >> Voidy is crazy. >> And then I can select it and look voidy. >> That is awesome. Very cool. And um yeah, and then you can basic cloud code can just place these assets in your app and tell cloud code exactly where to put them. And when you name it, it actually helps if you have a logo, right, and you name it logo. Just be like use like it'll know where to put it. If you if you give it 10 assets that are named properly, it'll just know what to do with them. >> Yeah. And that helps a lot. Like renaming and all these things really do go a long way. >> Totally. Let me >> Mine has created six mood characters. Anxious Alex, purple swirling tornado. Sorry, just the the dichotomy of those sounds is is throwing me right now. Gloomy Gray, Ember, the Angry, Scattered Sam, Hollow Haze, and Tension Test. Wow, that is amazing. So, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to generate icons for all of these. So there's six characters >> have characters for all of the moods. >> For all the moods. Yeah. And and if you notice here, the agent has actually given me think a, you know, a prompt to make this. Each character needs a friendly companion-like design. Think inside out style representing feelings, not villains, >> which is great. So I'm just literally writing that and then I'm putting the description it gave me. So an anxious Alex, purple swirling tornado, anxiety, worry, overthinking. Sounds like someone I know. me. >> No, I'm just going to do copy send and then gloomy gray. >> I cannot get the right sound effect for this >> gray blue cloud with rain parenthesis sadness melancholy loneliness and parenthesis. Okay. So, what I want to do >> generate another >> is I oops back into vibe space. >> Ember the angry fire emoji dash orange- red flame parenthesis anger frustration nitration parenthesis. I was generating on chat GPT some ideas uh for a button tap for my sound effects. I'm not great at prompting sound effects yet, but >> yeah, we know, >> dude. Calm down. >> I mean, look at this icon. >> I like it actually. These icon, dude, this model. So, this is GPT image one, which is just their main model, which can generate images without backgrounds. One of the only models that can actually do it well. And they're so good sometimes. I literally cannot generate a good sound effect for this. >> Scattered Sam, teal, fragmented orbs, parenthesis, overwhelm, confusion, mental fog. >> Um, use this cut. Put this in here. Paste. Okay, so now I actually need to focus on the actual core functionality of the app. and hm hollow haze dark indigo void parenthesis emptiness numbness disconnection tension tests yellow coiled spring parenthesis stress pressure burnout which is very common at early stage startups gloomy looking good too so I'm going to go to chat GPT real quick scattered Sam >> I'm going to upload this image here of the four types of meditations and so I'm going to say generate a transcript of an eightline meditation for each of these that relaxes the user or actually helps them with the thing that shows up right here for these four things breathe sleep and the other two. I want you to make this very much fitting for headspace the app. So right now we're just idiating with AI. I want you to respond with no header. Actually please don't make this numbered. just list the lines in a simple transcript. I'm going to see if we can generate these as music. Wow, this is a rear paradigm here is fire. Okay, so we're about 20 minutes in. I have my characters for the moods. I have it's already created this file for the different mood system and the questions answers. Now I'm going to tell it, okay, here are the characters. I'm going to give it the characters and then I'm going to tell it to actually create this mood flow. So, gonna start with anxious Alex. Anxious Alex is a crazy name. So, I've been locked in. I might I'm not going to do the moods. I'm going to have different teachers. That's how I'm going to switch it up. And so, I'm going to have 3D render of an icon. 3D render cartoon icon of a teacher of a fox. a fox. So, I'm just gonna call this one tension >> smooth character wearing. >> I'm gonna call this one >> shirt that says vibe >> hollow. Okay. So, >> now I'm going to add all of them to my prompt. So, you can see it add added all of them. I'm going say uh going to go one by one. I'm going to say Alex colon and then I'm going to say uh Ember colon kind of give it all the names here. >> So he generated all of his icons and he inserted them in the prompt and now he's basically going through the prompt and saying where each of the images will go. Basically that's what you're doing. Okay. Okay. So now I just need to insert hollow back hollow haze. Then I need to insert scattered Sam at the end here. >> So I didn't steal your moods idea, but I am going to have four different teachers and they are going to have different um functions. Now please insert the mood characters in the appropriate place and please build the entire questionnaire experience. Reference the plan as needed and focus on great clean design. Remember that the theme of this app is void. As you do this, I'm going to also in another prompt after this give you a background that you can use. But for now, you can put a different colored themed background for each one. The background I will give you later will be for the moods page as a whole. Each individual flow within it should have a nice space themed color themed background that represents the different flow that you're in. Okay, let's go to my audio. I do want to see how these songs turned out. >> After you finish this, then I will give you >> like give you I'm blanking right now. >> Happens with vibe coders. >> Yeah. Yeah, that's we're both like locked into our own little world right now. >> I know. I'm like after you finish, I'll give you and then just complete blank. What am I going to give you? Oh, the API access that you're going to use to generate the text that is going to help the user after they answer the question and you're going to use this to analyze it as well. All right. So, what I'm going to do is I'm basically giving this icon and this will show up as the breathe character. This will show up on the home list. Um please remember that the uh each of the four functions like breathe, love, focus etc has different characters and when I click on it like in the list it should have that image that I gave you earlier and then that image should show up big. If each of those are like little guided meditations and I want it to be taken to a new page that's white, but purple background should go from the top down to the bottom and like progress. Oh, and it should be a 10-minute timer, right? A 10-minute timer. And as you progress down uh through this meditation, the color should go down through the page. A questionnaire flow. don't have voice in this but have it be soothing and calming what the user is doing while listening to this is they are actually answering questions about a particular negative emotion or mood that they're having and after this we'll be giving the user some guidance. So this should be calming and soothing and at the end of it it should like get louder and louder while maintaining that soothing tone. Make it long. All right. So I just generated this love character. So this is my love character. I need to go 3D icon uh render cute character. So meditating. While you create those characters, I'm going to open the API tab here. And here you can see the different APIs that we have access to. So there's, you know, text gen, image gen, data, audio, and video. So, for this one, I'm going to want probably audio. Uh, probably some I mean, I can see what these do. So, audio transcription, high accurate speechtoext model. Oh, interesting. Um, that could be useful for this >> speech to text or text to speech. >> Well, text to speech is good, but speech to text could also be cool for a journaling feature. >> Ooh. Oh, journaling. Oh, I know what I'm doing next. >> Oh, man. uh 3D cute icon meditating wearing a shirt that says vibe space. >> So now I'm going to I'm going to add some APIs here and what I'm essentially going to do so APIs are different kind of external tools that companies have made. These are highly specialized tools for very specific use cases and it allows you know vibe coders or you know general enthusiasts to get access to really highly capable functionalities to use within their ideas. So here, you know, I don't know how to make a texttospech model, but someone else does. In this case, 11 Labs does. So I'm just going to select it here. Oh, cool. Text to speech. Great. When you want to make speech in your apps, chat bots respond with voice. So I'm going to add that to prompt. And then I'm going to tell it. Use this texttospech model to recite back to users the personalized advice that they get at the end of the mood questionnaire. >> I'm generating a nerd character. But but yes, I think of APIs like little Legos, like little Legos pieces that you can use for your app, you know, like you need I used to go to this the Lego store and see like Lego sets that has like a certain piece and I would buy it just for that Lego piece. You know, and 11 Labs has a ton of different APIs, but often you only need like one. >> And so we're basically putting all of those in this little API tab that you can just select and add it to your app. Little superpowers. >> They can also be like the glue, you know? They're like the glue for the Legos, too. >> Yes. And if you're But what's cool is like you don't have to wait for us to stock up the Lego store because we added also this EMV for this is a more advanced feature, but you can also add your own API keys here, which is basically the same as integrations or it can serve the same purpose. Um, and you can use any API. So, if you look up what APIs could I add to my app that would make it more futuristic or fun or cool, anything that you find, you can just add the variable in this tab. But that'll probably be a future video. We'll dive into that more. >> Yeah, that that's a little bit more of an advanced feature. And >> but I believe in you. You're advanced enough. >> Yeah, got you got to practice. It doesn't >> It's not hard. We we've done it in other videos like go to the OpenAI website, grab the key, and then all you got to do is add it to this tab and then tell it in the prompt, hey, I want you to use this, look up whatever relevant links you need to look up and integrate. Yes, exactly. Here, I'm going to add for creating the text that you're going to use 11 Labs to speak out to the user. I want you to use this API to analyze the user's responses from the mood questionnaire and then generate the personalized advice. Make sure to specify what the kind of inputs should be from in terms of what the structure of the data from the mood questionnaire should be into this API so that we can get a consistent response and render it correctly. Remember, we don't want to make mistakes here. It is important that this flow works. >> Look at this. So, I got breathe and it turns purple and so at the end it'll go all the way through the app. So, it's it's it's 10 minutes and just for testing purposes because I want to see what it looks like. >> You're going to tell it to speed up. >> I want you to please add a plus one minute button. It should be tiny at the bottom of all of these little pages just so I can simulate the passage of time. And look at this. So, what I just did is I just queued up a prompt. I just added a bunch of new characters. And now Claude Code is going to work. It's basically working its way through all of these tasks. It's adding the love meditation screen, the sleep meditation screen, and the focus meditation screen with those different characters. And it's going to create something that looks a lot like this. Right here, we have this page in our app right here. Right. I created this breathe option >> and it it basically goes through here. But I basically added one prompt and then I added this prompt here, Q1 of one. So I can add in follow-up prompts. So as soon as Cloud Code's done, it'll add it again. >> Dude, look at mine. >> Ooh, you know, the purple's overdone. That's pretty purple, my dude. >> It is pretty purple. >> But like I I think you're on the right track. Um Oh, look at this red. No, I don't want to look at your app. I want to focus on >> this red. >> That's pretty nice, but it's also like scary a little bit. >> All right. All right. I mean, I I I see what you're doing. I see what you're doing. Um, >> yeah, there is something that needs to be done. This design isn't great. >> We do have 27 minutes left. So, this is the time to start moving towards like refining. You at least want to get your Halo feature. Like that one screen on your app that looks good, that's like sharable for social media, you know, that like people are like, "Oh, that app is sick." >> I don't know what it is yet, though. Okay, we're going to pause it here. And I like to do this. I'm going to call this like a halftime. and I would like to kind of center ourselves and get an idea of what we're both doing um so that people can follow along with like how we're creating our app and what our plans are for the rest of this competition. So, I'll let you go first. >> Yeah. So, I can kind of summarize what I've gone through. Uh I did just fix a couple of bugs. Um we have this really cool feature now where you can if there's an error, you can actually fix it for free. So, we don't charge you when the agent makes a mistake. You just press fix and it'll do it. And the the tokens that are used to fix the error aren't >> completely free and all you need to do is literally just click fix with AI. It's great. So, I'm going to refresh the app and I can kind of go through what I've done so far. Before I do that, what I've focused on implementing here is the moods. So, there's six different moods. Each mood represents a different negative emotion. You click on each one and there's a questionnaire about the mood to gauge how you're feeling. Then from there, we use Open AI's GPT5 mini in order to analyze your responses and generate personalized advice. Then we use 11 Labs text to speech to then read that advice back to you in a calming tone. Gotcha. So onboarding takes what you say during onboarding which is just a list of questions just to reiterate here and then it'll a custom meditation for you or speech and then 11 labs reads it back in a fun ideally a fun way >> kind of I don't have an onboarding it's dependent on the mood you pick questions. >> Gotcha. Gotcha. >> Yeah. So I' I've taken a slightly different approach where I'm focused more so on maximum value to the user and kind of just drop them in and let them do. So my onboarding is literally just what's your name? >> The voice working yet or is that not working? Oh, go ahead and test it during this. >> Let's find out. >> No generating code during halftime, but let's let's check this out. >> So I'm going to click refresh app and immediately hop in here. So welcome Vashall. Take a deep breath and enter the void. >> Take a deep breath. How are you feeling? So, I'm going to pick a mood to explore. I'm not super happy with the design, but we can just kind of go in here. I'm going to do anxious Alex. What triggered this anxious feeling? Deadline or responsibility? You know, getting this new version out. How do I feel this? Kind of just like probably tension. Honestly, I need to do probably sit with better posture. How fast are your thoughts moving? Right now, I'm stuck about one particular worry of losing to Riley. Um, what if I tried to calm down? I don't even know what to do and how much control do I feel mostly in control so I can get some guidance. It's not a good animation at all but can revisit that. I think what I'm going to do is make it do like a breathing exercise while it's doing this. >> Gotcha. So what's your feedback? My feedback on your app is that I think the it might sound worse than you think. Like I think the generated speech might I think 30 minutes might be tough for you to get that right. You know what I mean? Like I think you might run into problems there. >> And then I think you have like polishing up to do with the animations, but I think you can get there. Um, are you going to play music at the same time as the voice is playing? >> Yes. >> Okay, that'll be nice. >> I'm going to do that. I have the audio for that actually already ready and I have an onboarding audio that is ready as well. So my really only two goals is I'm going to remove the vibes tab because I think it was a little too ambitious at the beginning. only going to focus on the moods here. The goal is to be void without mood to be levelheaded. >> I see. >> Exactly. >> That makes sense. >> Yeah. So, I'm just going to focus on audio cleaning up and making sure it works. >> Great. That sounds good. I think you're you're in a good spot. >> Yeah. >> Should I go? >> Yeah. >> Okay. So, my app so far, Vibes, let's take a look at this. This is the onboarding, right? So, you enter the app. It's like find your piece. >> See that new noise I have? If you listen carefully. Are the Are those birds? >> What? >> In the background of it. It is actually. Yeah. I didn't add them separately. It was just 11 laps, but it's a nice noise. Huh. Yeah. Um and then I'm going to get rid of these quick start options. And it's just like recommended for you. So you can breathe, you can love, you can sleep, and you can focus. Um, and um, so I can press sleep and then I can start the timer. As soon as I start the timer, the music plays. >> Is this the same music? >> I'll rotate the music. I just I just This is how I think about it. Like I just put things in kind of placeholders. So the music and then I can change >> swap them out. >> I can swap them out later. That's really easy. As long as it gets the logic right. Like if I try and do that, >> if you do it, if you kind of create this blank canvas and then you rotate the assets later, except with the the icons I like to do up front because it's fun to see, get the mood. But um yeah, this this works really well. Um this like progress bar, >> come on, that looks pretty nice. Like this screen looks fantastic in my opinion. Uh I basically have no notes other than like make the music a little bit better. I think the app is a little too simple. Like I feel like it might need a little zest and I don't know which direction to go to add zest but that's kind of what I'm thinking. I don't know even know what this morning meditation thing could do but I don't know maybe a little journal entry and then some guided like meditation advice or something for it like a quick a quick meditation but I'm not sure which direction I'll go. I'll probably decide that once we're once we're live again because I think better when I'm under pressure. >> Yeah. No, that makes sense. Um, I'd say my feedback is I think it looks great. I think you've nailed the kind of aesthetics here. I think the main things that I think you should focus on is what is the I really like the morning meditation at the top. I think you can do some kind of like daily exercise, whether it's daily journal, daily like whether it asks you questions. I think it's missing that like one of the best things about AI is that it's personalized and can be personalized to you. So, I think there's something that you can do there. Like, we have a lot of capabilities. You can have it do something specific to the user, maybe in like a daily sense or journaling sense or something. >> I think I think this is useful. I'm I'm getting some ideas there. >> Yeah. >> Okay. I like it. >> Have you picked a name? >> Vibes. >> Vibes. >> Yeah. I mean, look at look at my all my characters are wearing a Vibespace shirt. >> I don't know if you saw that. >> Very nice. Very nice. >> Yeah. I love how we've settled into our like patterns here where like I'm always going for like the overly ambitious like Hail Marys. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> And you're always >> I'm trying to get those get the get everything right and maybe I should I I'll get over ambitious maybe in in in a future one. But you know like I want to nail the experience, you know, like I feel like so much of it is on aesthetics, but I think I think I'm ready to hop back in. I I I have I think everyone has clarity of our apps and I have >> I have some direction. So I think >> let's hop back in. >> Let's hop back in. All right. So that was halftime. >> Let the games begin. Okay. So the first thing I want you to do is I want you to improve the overall design and aesthetic of the app. It looks like the buttons are a little chunky and the design feels a little dated. I want something that's a clean, modern aesthetic in terms of the styling of it. Second of all, the I want to remove the vibes tab and solely focus on the mood for now. Can you make those changes for me? So, I'm going to fire that off first. Now, I'm going to check if the text to speech error has been resolved. All right, I just said remove these um quick start options here and so I just want this recommended for you. Now I need a morning meditation. >> So we got 25 minutes for the morning meditation. When I click on it, I want it to be a >> Ember. It makes total sense that you're feeling angry, feeling disrespected. >> I knew it would sound like that. Um what you can do and I will allow you to go on your computer to do this is you can go to 11 Labs and all you need to do is look for the voice ID and you can give it to um >> give it to the agent. >> Yeah. And also like if that was something that we wanted to add to the vibe code app is like further customizability on certain APIs like that would be one thing. >> No, that would be good. >> Yeah. Okay. So for the morning meditation, when I click on it, I want to be a quick little journal and change it to morning meditation journal and add a little book icon. And I want this page to be blank for me to write my moods. And I want after I press enter to make it feel like the page is turning. And then I want AI to generate a three sentence response that helps people get over whatever it is that they're struggling with or their feelings or thoughts act as like a therapist. And these should be like logged both the quest the journal entry and the AI response. So, I'm going to go to APIs. I'm going to use this OpenAI. Let's actually use Gemini 2.5. We'll see if that works. Use this. Okay. I just fired that one off. >> So, right now I'm just using chat GPT to quickly get these voice IDs. >> Oh, nice. Nice. >> Yeah. Asking who the most calming team voice is. >> So, Adam is the most common one. I hear it on social media. You've heard the voice. Really? Sure. >> Yes. Then then we're going Adam for sure. >> All right. Good luck. Here is the voice ID for Why is my Siri on? Adam for the 11 Labs text to speech. Please update to use this voice ID. So just fire that off real quick. Download. Enter in. Okay. So cool. We're just one page now. So I'm generating an image for a book. And I always copy it before and I just paste it in. I just do like six of the same ones on icon. I'm still not a huge fan of this design. >> Please, >> it makes complete >> ground of the app. a more of a gradient instead of plain white, but it should be partly white, like an off white or something, and make the list. >> So, while it does >> of things on the homepage, the sleep love. >> I'm really sorry you're feeling this empty and hollow right now. >> You've heard that voice on short form content before. >> I've definitely heard it before. Um, that's hilarious. Um, what else was going to do? Homepage and sleep love. Um, >> why isn't the voice working? Can you slow down the voice too? Want it? Use Antony instead. >> All right. So now book settings like this one. >> Give it the settings from chat GPT. Also when the mood is generating I don't want the icon to spin. Instead, show Voidy, the mascot for the app, and have him slowly pulsate while waiting for the user to do deep breaths with a calming in and out animation. Send that. And then I'm also going to send another Open it up again. All right. So, I'm firing off. Okay. So, I just added this icon for the morning journal here. And I've added this AI feature. So, it asks you, "How am I feeling today? I'm feeling tired." And then I can hit submit. I kind of like this, but like not fully. The animation is weird when it tries to flip the page. I'm going to make sure I tell the agent that. By the way, So, I'm going to add this audio. So, what I'm doing right now is modifying the onboarding to play this noise and wait until it's done to bring the user into the app. So, while the user is in the app, play this sound the entire time. Even keep it going. Oh, it's pretty bad. Got to retype it. Oh man. Onboarding. To play this audio the entire time in onboarding. Please do not go into the app until the audio is done playing. In the onboarding, add two more screens. We have the one for their name. I want the background of these screens to be spacethemed. And I want there to be two more screens. The second screen should ask the user the the second screen should just be an animated text where a couple points about the app come up and how we're going to help. And then the third one is the deep breathing one where the user stays there. And they must stay there until they've done at least 30 seconds of deep breathing. And we should play this audio the entire time during onboarding. You cannot go into the app until you're done. Just waiting for it to do that. I'm going to say >> for the calendar, can you please make it so that it's on a separate page? Like if I click on it, it should take me to the calendar. Don't just put it at the top right. >> So, edit that. >> Redo that. >> Let's see what it's done with the voice here. I'm really hoping for something good. I like that character, by the way. Your character there, Voidy. It's fire. Um, all right. So, I breathe in, breathe out. >> It makes a lot of sense that thinking about the future would set off this ner. >> I'm telling you, bro, this 11 Labs, dude, we need like a more >> a more calming voice model in here or something. >> We do. We do. I'm just going to keep rolling with it. So, please play this audio in the background the entire time the user is in the app. Even when are >> even when the questionnaire and the text to speech is going on. This is the background noise for the entire app. So I've queued up a prompt just there. Um and I'm going to let it use that as well. So my agent is still going. I cued a prompt. Uh the seems like the first one finished. The next prompt I cued is to play this audio in the background. >> That is a good good meditation sound right there. >> And and this should play the entire time you're in the app. It's 5 minutes long. >> Oh wow. When you can get it to loop as well. >> Yeah, exactly. >> Um and have that other calming one. So hopefully we should have both of those. Um, I actually switched the model to Opus, uh, because I feel like it wasn't getting the design right. Um, so I don't know if Opus will help at all, but I don't know. Let's find out. We will see. Mine's just updating forever. I don't know what's going on here. So, I'm just going to wait for mine to finish and then we'll give it a try. I will say I really need to figure out the design. I think my app is way better than yours if the design was right. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think your mind I think >> I think I know what I'm gonna do. >> Oh no. Don't do it. >> You know what I'm going to tell it. Think like Steve Jobs. >> Oh god. No. I'm >> Dude, you got to turn that. Is that yours still? What? Dude, mine's something's wrong. Maybe I'll just leave and come back. All right. So this is now what mine looks like. I have this little calendar thing. It's like a GitHub calendar. >> So, I have this little calendar. Oh, I kind of like this like yellow background. Kind of looks good. >> I don't really like the yellow. >> Yeah, I definitely don't like the yellow submit button. Oh my god, >> look at my new onboarding. >> Dude, you got to I got to figure out how to do that. Just like get that. All right, I got to lock in. Can you please get rid of the GitHub style little map thing there, but keep everything else the same? Like, I love the list of journal entries. I like that a lot. Also, please make the buttons in the morning journal not that yellow color. Make them black with white text on them. Um, so that'll just make that design a lot better. And then for the morning journal, please make that text a much larger. And if you can change the font of the uh journal section because I don't like how I want it to be different. print meant to be like a handwriting written. >> I need to have a skip button for this. >> Just do >> I also want you in the list of journals, I want you to please make the input text bigger than the AI response and don't label it AI response. Instead, use one of the icons that we used earlier on the main page as like the the response to it. Um, and it's like a character. Don't say AI response, but like have it look like like a message bubble from the character that they're responding to it. Actually, you know what? In fact, scratch all of that. I want you to use AI based on the person's response, select which one should respond, the breathe, love, sleep, or focus. And um that should be the one that responds. So, if someone needs to breathe and and relax, then the breathe guy should respond. But if someone is talking about love, the love guy should respond. That's what you should do. and then have those characters have little uh one per morning journal. So it's and it'll tell you which one you should do and then at Yeah, do that. Can you turn your a computer audio down? >> It's just going to keep playing it drifting into the void. [Laughter] >> Oh, you're just waiting in a timer right now. That's crazy. >> I screwed myself. Oh no. Okay, we're entering the void now. Oh, nice. We're in. Okay. Oh, nice. Can't tell if mine or yours. Oh, they were both going at the same time. Yeah. Okay. on the main page. Please add little outlines around the items in the list. Right now, it's a little bit hard to see them. >> Sorry. >> You're good. >> That thinking about the future would bring up anxious feelings. Uncertainty about what's ahead can tighten your chest and make your mind race. Your body's reaction, the stomach discomfort and nausea, is a common part of the mind body connection. >> It's not bad. When thoughts speed up and your brain interprets threat, your nervous system can send signals to your gut. Noticing that your thoughts are faster than usual and that distraction has been your go-to tells me you're actively trying to cope, even if it hasn't felt like real relief. >> Bro, meditation app for robots, too. >> Robots. >> That's wild, dude. It sounds like >> Oh, let's go. I got that cursive [ __ ] going on. >> Oh my god. >> Let's go. I'm Oh, I love it. I'm >> Okay, I need to log into design. Okay, I think my app is working. Other Okay, I need you to focus heavily on design right now. You need to personify and completely embody Steve Jobs. Every single person who comes in here, you're making me laugh. I need to focus on my prompt. I have seven minutes. I need you to redesign the entire dashboard, questionnaire, and final screen where it shows the advice for the dashboard and questionnaire. Please stop using this small font and border button style. Please rethink from ground up a nice minimal style that fits the design and feel of a mental health and wellness app called Void. And then I I know I know a mental thing I'm going to add right now. Focus on the best human human interface design patterns from Apple. As you're thinking about the design of this app, it should look and feel native while maintaining that space themed deep purple gradient vibe that we have going on. Also, I want the loading screen for both when you're entering into the app during onboarding and also when the speech is generating to have the icon in the center. And I want to have like a pulsing halo gradient beneath the icon that grows and shrinks as you breathe in and out. There's too much text on these pages. Just focus on the icon, the pulse/halo, and a couple calming words of breathing in and out. That's it. Okay. So, by the way, if you press this little camera icon right here, um it automatically inserts this screenshot into the app. So that's what I'm doing right now. Um, it didn't add that last feature that I want. So it looks like it shows the AI guidance. Instead, it should show one of the characters. >> Also, show the user's name in the app title. So, how are you feeling, name? And I want you to see if you can slow down the voice a little bit more or have it be a slightly deeper tone, like a more tenor tone. Let's see if this works. What else would be good? >> You better get your la final prompts in. We're We're approaching the end. >> Dashboard with the mood options is good, but I want a little bit less text and actually show the characters there. I see you've put like kind of placeholders or they're not rendering correctly. Make sure the characters can be shown there. I don't want the characters during the questionnaire as much. I want the questionnaire to feel simple, minimal, and clean with the icons shown on the homepage. You can also use the icons on the respective loading screens before the speech to text is generated. So, I'm going to cue that up as well. So, I realized that my onboarding is no longer about like what my app does. So, that's what I'm changing. Change the onboarding copy. Choose from the four options. basically summarize what the app does in the onboarding and educate the user properly on the specific features of the app. Nothing else. Keep it only three. The icon should stay the same. >> Themed mental health and meditation app background for dashboard and copy this. Send it. And then I'm also going to make one for breathe in and out page. So I'm going to rip some backgrounds right now. see if I can add them in in >> in the time up to the bell. >> I already got another prompt queued up. >> That's fire. >> So, I'm gonna have two prompts queued up along with a current one that's going. Oh, wow. Let's go. Riley [Music] >> look at my app now. >> Oh, God. Don't show me that. Please look at the journal history and show how the Oh, >> the responses backgrounds are like a slightly different color. I want them to be the same as the card. So, like that white color. Please make it the cards look the same. Okay, so I'm just launching in my final fixes here. Yeah, my app has way less features than yours, I will definitely say. Um, >> here are two backgrounds. >> We have this for the views. It's very calming actually. This is what vibe coding should feel like. >> Yes. >> Use for the views for dashboard and questionnaire. use appropriately while maintaining the great look and feel of the app. Also show the user's name on dashboard. Also going to fire that up. Okay, last 30 seconds. Oh man, I think I'm good. I've I've fired up another I've queued up another. This prompt is almost done. Uh yeah, I am in Hail Mary mode now. So >> better lock in 10 >> etc. >> Okay, I just fired off my final. >> Three, two, one, done. That's it. >> That's it. >> That's it. I'm going to just pause the meditation music for now. I honestly froze up. I I feel like I froze up. I didn't know what to add. I feel like I didn't have a specific idea in mind. I wish I came into this video with a little bit more of a specific idea in my mind. >> Um, and I ended up with an app that was fine. I thought I was exe like I still think my app is going to be better designed than yours. I think yours is going to be flashier. You think it's going to be yours is going to be better after? >> I think I just I think I was, you know, game seven LeBron. I think I was Tom Brady versus the Hawks. I think I just threw a crazy >> I just lo >> What happened? >> Oh no. I think I just literally messed up the design of my app on this last prompt. Um, wait. It added a border in the wrong place. It added a border around these little characters, but like I don't think it's that bad. >> It's not that bad. >> Um, I I do think I clutched up on the design at the very end. >> We'll see. We'll see. How do you have any queued up or your yours is >> my my final queue was sent already? >> Okay. Okay. Your final queue is sent already. So, we're just waiting for another like minute or so. >> Yeah. So, right now it's just updating the read me to doc. >> Okay. I think why don't I go first while my yours is loading? Mine's like completely done, I believe. >> So So you want to maybe um click refresh app? >> I'll click refresh app >> and hop in. >> This is my final app. So this is the full experience. I'm going to turn up the volume. Can you potentially just unplug yours for a second? Your phone >> or at the homepage? >> Yeah, there you go. So this is my final app here. This is Vibespace. This is the final app that I created. We'll see. I I I I I need to get a good idea of the app here. So, it has this nice song. You can hear it. Nice. Ooh, I like that transition. And then you enter the app and you have basically four options or you have two options, right? You can journal your ideas, like your thoughts. So, that's the first thing you can do is you can journal. How are you feeling today? I'm feeling a little anxious. And you can submit this and it'll give you a little like response. I didn't get a chance to add the little character here, but here it added I do not like the little border it added. I literally added the border. It was supposed to add it around the whole card, not around the little character. >> But >> that's what we got. And so one of these little characters responds to me, which is kind of nice. >> Nice. >> Um, and that's the journal history. It keeps everything stored locally on our phone. And then, um, we can do guided meditations, which I've gone through already. Here's sleep. >> And I didn't add individual songs for each one. I couldn't figure out how to prompt it to get like good sleep meditation. >> Yeah. >> Um, this generating the assets. I mean, I I would take a lot of time on this. Like if I was actually if it wasn't timed, maybe we should do one where we have four hours next time. Yeah. >> And we could really drill in and I I >> I I truly think we could get something very close to like Headspace. >> I really think if we just sat down for 4 hours, I would record my own audio first of all. That's what I would do. Like I would I would write it. I would get Chat GBT out and help me like outline it. Then I would actually read it. Like I would take 40 minutes. I would read the audio in a quiet room with a nice microphone and I would try and make the experience better because I think that those types of things now that it's possible to just open up your phone and add audio. You can add your own audio. >> They go a long way especially like with in the mental health space like it's it's really >> it almost does a disservice for us to make it timed. Like maybe we should do a full weekend or to see who can make a better app. I I really think we could get pretty close. Like your if we combine your app with mine with maybe some like spoken or like guided meditation. >> Yeah. Be fire. Be amazing. It'd be just as good. I I wouldn't have the the British accent that the the headsp space guy has, which is huge plus. Huge plus. >> I did tell it to make the voice deeper in tone >> on my second last prompt. >> So I don't know. >> You tried to change its tone. That's going to be hard, dude. How do you think it go? >> I haven't I really haven't used 11 Labs. >> Okay, so so but yeah, this is my app and obviously it has this >> I really like that like going all the way through. >> It's that I think is like the best design feature. This is the best screen of the app right here is you choose your mood, you meditate through it, and you're done once it loads fully through. I love this actually. Like >> I think yours has great design. And I really like whatever like kind of rounded font that it fixed. Yeah, I like it. >> Anyway, let's see. What's your name? Void. >> Void. Let's see it. >> So, going to open up Void. If you all remember, I fired off two prompts telling you to become and embody Steve Jobs. So, let's see if it did that or not. So, so breathe in and out. Oh, no. No. Oh. Oh, thank god it's loading. I was >> Did you just add that? >> I was so worried it wasn't going to load in. Yeah. >> Okay. So, you have this background. >> How are you feeling today? Anxious, gloomy, angry, scattered, hollow, or tense? I'm going to go. >> This is so good. >> Anxious. What triggered this anxious feeling? So, have like a custom background. A specific event or conversation. Where do you feel it? some energy stuck on a worry um say distraction scrolling and I have some control now you can breathe in breathe out and it's very calming you see Voidy our mascot of Void the mental health and wellness app yeah your app is so good dude >> it makes complete sense that you're feeling shaken after a specific conversation or event that kind trigger can leave your body buzzing and your mind glued to a single worry. What you're describing, restless energy in your limbs and a thought that won't let go is a very common way anxiety shows up. >> Brain, >> so it'll go all the way through. >> Val, well done, man. You cooked for 1 hour, bro. You cooked. >> Yeah, it's a bit slow to load. See, that's one thing we need to figure out is like the PGs like lo it takes >> loading this takes a while. >> Yeah. I don't know why. I think >> I don't know how to solve that problem. >> We'll figure it out. >> We'll figure it out. I know. >> We'll get it done. Guaranteed. >> Think about what you did though in this episode. It's very impressive that you implemented an AI feature and then you got >> I got it to read it out. It asks you questions based on your mood. There's custom icons, a questionnaire, and then based on what you say, it gives you advice and says it back to you. >> Mhm. Yeah, I think that's really really good. You could even add like a little like text input field on the last one to like make it even more cuz it is multiple choice. That's one thing >> that would be a good idea >> because it is just responding to your multiple choice like >> but >> I like it. I I think you did a great job. And just to like show go show the users, go back into pinch and go through go into the API tab. And so which APIs did you use again? >> So I used OpenAI GPT5 mini. This was used to analyze the user's responses and I used 11 Labs flash 2.5 text to speech. So I use this to actually take that text that OpenAI GBT5 generated and speak it back to you. >> That is really powerful. You did that all in an hour. Generated every asset >> in the app. But tell me this image generation like this is ch game gamechanging. >> It's great. Like we literally used four different um or I guess I used four different AI models to literally build this app and I didn't write a single line of code. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> And I mean I mean the the the 11 Labs music is a different model, you know, like that is a music model. It's different than the speech model. It's different than the sound effects model. Yeah. You know, it's it's insane. And so I think next episode we should collaborate and we should actually sit down maybe three hours and build like an app that's like amazing. Yeah. And I think we can I think we could do some insane things. For those of you who are watching, those are the two apps we have. Vibes and Void. This was a very fun match. And yeah, let us know in the comments who do you think won. We're going to be giving away Vibe Code credits. And you know, we may increase it from what I said earlier, which was $50 to 25 people. we may just feel nice and increase it because this launch we just put two straight months into building this app and Michelle went to town basically working for two months straight like you probably didn't miss a day coding like you were probably coding every day >> not at all it's it's been a grind and I'm very excited for you all to try it >> yeah and then also one thing I really want people's feedback >> how can we change these tabs right let us know in the comments what API should we add we certainly didn't add all of the useful APIs right we are going to make this so powerful. Like any API that you might want to use that would make your app more immersive, more fun, and just better. We want to add to the app. So, let us know in the comments. We'll give out free credits if we end up using your advice. Um, >> we'll give you free credits and we'll add your API. Uh, one of the ones I wanted, the movie database. You can literally like fetch top movie posters as they come out and use that in your app. >> Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can create a basically an IMDb wrapper except it's called TMDB because IMDb doesn't have a API but like >> you can use nano banana. >> Yes, >> the most popular image generation model in the world. >> Yes, we can do that. >> There's a lot of fun things and coming very soon is cloud which is going to be a gamecher if you want to make your apps go from just yourself to multiplayer in reality. in reality. And then that is a precursor for payments which we're also adding soon which you'll be able to charge people but you can't charge people in the app based on their usage unless you have authentication and database which is part of the cloud. >> Exactly. So there's a lot of fun stuff cooking. Uh we're very excited for you all to check it out. >> Yeah. And if you uh want a complete guide to using this app, I just recorded an hourong video of me going through every single feature in depth and in detail. So you can find that in the description below. Shaw, good match, >> good game. >> Next time we'll collaborate. Let us know what we should build next time.
