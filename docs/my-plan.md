Once Generate PRD is pressed we move to the plan stage and the tickets are created and placed in the "To do" column in order at the moment only one ticket can be worked on at a time in the progress column, when a ticket goes into the in progress coloumn, the code tab is active ticket goes into code chat box and it automatically starts work.  when the code agent is finished the user is notified and can ask for changes and give feedback. At his stage user can eiither drop the ticket in the done column or drop it in the qa column. do we have the ability to do this or do we need something like https://www.inngest.com/ I would like there to be another agent that job is to qa the code that the code agent wrote once qa is passed the user is notified by ping sound an  once the user is happy with the work they can move the ticket to done. The user will  then take the next ticket in the "To do" list and move it to the "In progress" list the cycle repeats again. In settings there should be a yolo mode that is of by default but once it is on everything is handled by the agents.
