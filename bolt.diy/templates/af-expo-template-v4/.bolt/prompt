⚠️⚠️⚠️ EXPO TEMPLATE - CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️⚠️⚠️

THIS IS AN EXPO TEMPLATE. The template has been pre-configured for both E2B and WebContainer.

🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THE SCRIPTS SECTION 🚨

The package.json "scripts" section has been automatically configured with the correct flags.
DO NOT add, remove, or modify ANY scripts in package.json.

The scripts are already correct:
"scripts": {
  "dev": "EXPO_NO_TELEMETRY=1 npx expo start --tunnel",
  "start": "EXPO_NO_TELEMETRY=1 npx expo start --tunnel"
}

✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] DO NOT modify package.json scripts section
- [ ] .npmrc file is included (handles peer dependencies)
- [ ] babel.config.js is included (required for Expo)
- [ ] npm install runs before npm run dev

The template includes:
- .npmrc with legacy-peer-deps=true (fixes React peer dependency conflicts)
- babel.config.js (required for Expo transpilation)
- Pre-configured Expo Router with tabs
- All required dependencies in package.json
- Asset folders with icons and splash screens

⚠️ DO NOT skip, remove, or modify any template files - they are all required.
⚠️ ESPECIALLY: DO NOT modify the "scripts" section of package.json.
